# How to Display Hebrew Dates in Google Calendar

You can now display Hebrew calendar dates (alongside the normal Gregorian headings) in Google Calendar on the web. To enable it:

1. Log into to your calendar
2. Go into Settings (click the gear icon in the upper right and select "Settings" from the menu).
3. Under the General tab (which should be the one that's active), scroll down to the "Alternate Calendar" option (it's third from the bottom for me).
4. Select "Hebrew calendar" from the dropdown.
5. Click the Save button at the bottom.

Now, you should see Hebrew dates alongside the English ones in your calendar.
